# BigBiGAN
Runway Port of BigBiGAN from the paper "Large Scale Adversarial Representation Learning"

## Paper
The BigBiGAN was introduced in the paper [Large Scale Adversarial Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02544) by Jeff Donahue, Karen Simonyan at DeepMind.

## Colab Notebook"
Code was adapted from the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/bigbigan_with_tf_hub.ipynb) with weights provided by DeepMind.
